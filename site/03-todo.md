# TODO
- CIFS/LAN OS guides (screens)
- Add / verify ALL links in the **UI** go to the right place in docs
- Fontawesome - Tor box (connecting) needs icon - device guides need OS icons
- Initial Setup
- Lightning Guides (Zeus)
- Vaultwarden guide (screens)
- Refactor and update Roadmap

# BLOCKED:
- Possible sounds in troubleshooting (and overview / update migrate with links)
- Alt Market Build Guide

# AFTER PUBLISHING:
- Close all relevant issues (some await new processes in order to test)
- Add new video content
- Breakout Bitcoin / Lightning integrations into their own individual pages
- Create badges for device guide topic boxes <connectivity, performance, resilience and/or tuning>
- Connecting LAN/Tor nesting isn't great
- Migrate from other server projects / nodes (currently punted)
