.. tip:: Please see Mac's :ref:`Known Limitations<lim-mac>` to understand what is currently not possible on these devices

* :ref:`Connecting over LAN <lan-mac>` - For a fast and secure connection while on your Embassy's local network
* :ref:`Connecting over Tor <tor-mac>` - Run Tor natively (in the background) on your device.  This will allow you to use applications on your machine via the Tor Network so they can communicate with your Embassy.
* :ref:`Tor Firefox Config <torff-mac>` - Configure Firefox to use the Tor Network so that you can reach ``.onion`` sites without needing to change browsers.
* :ref:`SNF Setup <cifs-mac>` - Configure a Shared Network Folder on your laptop/desktop (or an external drive plugged into your laptop/desktop) in order to use it for Embassy backups.
