To optimize your device for use with your Embassy, it is recommended to complete all of the following guides.

.. tip:: Please see Linux's :ref:`Known Limitations<lim-linux>` to understand what is currently not possible on these devices

* :ref:`Connecting over LAN <lan-linux>` - For a fast and secure connection while on your Embassy's local network
* :ref:`Connecting over Tor <tor-linux>` - Run Tor natively (in the background) on your device.  This will allow you to use applications on your machine via the Tor Network so they can communicate with your Embassy.
* :ref:`Tor Firefox Config <torff-linux>` - Configure Firefox to use the Tor Network so that you can reach ``.onion`` sites without needing to change browsers.
* :ref:`LAN Shared Folder Setup <cifs-linux>` - Configure a Shared Network Folder on your laptop/desktop (or an external drive plugged into your laptop/desktop) in order to use it for Embassy backups.
