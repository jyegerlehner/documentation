Alt Marketplaces
================

It is critical to Start9's mission that Start9 NOT be a central point of failure.  The Marketplace is a critical piece of infrastructure and therefore EmbassyOS supports accessing alternative marketplaces.

.. caution:: Start9 is not responsible for issues encountered when downloading services from alternative marketplaces, and cannot provide support for services that are not from our offical marketplace.  Here be dragons!!

.. note:: Currently this change will allow you to download services from a Marketplace of your choice.  At this time, EmbassyOS updates on alternative Marketplaces are not supported.

#. Go to Embassy -> Marketplace Settings

#. Click "Add Alternative Marketplace" and enter the URL of your desired Marketplace.  You may connect immediately, or save for use later

.. note:: Make sure you have the URL **EXACTLY CORRECT.**  If you do not, your Embassy may crash.  In this case, just reboot the device and try again.
