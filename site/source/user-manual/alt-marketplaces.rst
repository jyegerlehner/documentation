Alt Marketplaces
================

It is critical to Start9's mission that Start9 is **not** a central point of failure. The Marketplace is a critical piece of infrastructure and therefore EmbassyOS supports accessing alternative marketplaces.

.. caution:: Start9 is not responsible for issues encountered when downloading services from alternative marketplaces, and cannot provide support for services that are not from our official marketplace. Here be dragons!!

.. note:: Currently this change will only permit the downloading of *services* from alternative marketplaces. EmbassyOS itself may only be obtained from Start9.

#. Go to *Embassy > Marketplace Settings*.

#. Click "Add Alternative Marketplace" and enter the URL of your desired Marketplace. You may connect immediately, or save for later use.
