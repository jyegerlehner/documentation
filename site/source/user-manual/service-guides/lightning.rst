To use a Spark client, you still need to have Spark installed on the Embassy.  The Spark service on Embassy is both a server (background service) and a client (the :ref:`Web UI<web-ui>`).  Under Properties, there is a "Pairing URL". The first part of this is the server URL, and the end portion of it is the access key.
