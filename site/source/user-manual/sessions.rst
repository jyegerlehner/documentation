Session Management
==================

Every time a login is made with Embassy, such as from a web browser on your laptop or mobile device, a :ref:`Session <sessions>` is created.

* To view and manage your active sessions, go to *Embassy > Active Sessions*.

* To end an active session and log out of that device, click "Kill" to the right of your selection.
