Tor Setup (Connectivity)
------------------------

`Setup Tor <docs.start9.com/user-manual/configuration/tor-setup/tor-os/tor-android>`_ to run natively (in the background) on your device.  This will allow you to use applications on your Android via the :ref:`Tor Network<tor>` so they can communicate with your Embassy.

Tor Firefox Config (Connectivity)
---------------------------------

`Configure Firefox <docs.start9.com/user-manual/configuration/tor-setup/tor-firefox/torff-android>`_ to be able to use the :ref:`Tor Network<tor>` so that you can reach ``.onion`` sites without needing to change browsers.

.. note:: Please see Android's :ref:`Known Limitations<lim-android>` to understand what is currently not possible on these devices
