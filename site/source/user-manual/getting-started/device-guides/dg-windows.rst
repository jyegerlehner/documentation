LAN Setup (Connectivity, Performance)
-------------------------------------

`Setup LAN Access <docs.start9.com/user-manual/configuration/lan-setup/lan-windows>`_ for a fast and secure connection while on your Embassy's local network.

Tor Setup (Connectivity)
------------------------

`Setup Tor <docs.start9.com/user-manual/configuration/tor-setup/tor-os/tor-windows>`_ to run natively (in the background) on your device.  This will allow you to use applications on your Windows machine via the :ref:`Tor Network<tor>` so they can communicate with your Embassy.

Tor Firefox Config (Connectivity)
---------------------------------

`Configure Firefox <docs.start9.com/user-manual/configuration/tor-setup/tor-firefox/torff-windows>`_ to be able to use the :ref:`Tor Network<tor>` so that you can reach ``.onion`` sites without needing to change browsers.

.. note:: Please see Window's :ref:`Known Limitations<lim-windows>` to understand what is currently not possible on these devices
