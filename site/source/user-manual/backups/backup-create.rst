Creating Backups
================

There are 2 options for backing up your Embassy and service data:

1. Use a Shared Network Folder (recommended) on another device that connected to the same network as your Embassy, such as a laptop/desktop or external drive that is plugged into your laptop/desktop.
2. Use a physical drive, which must be externally powered or plugged into a powered USB hub.

LAN Backups
-----------

This is the recommended approach for creating backups.

#. Follow instructions for creating a :ref:`Shared Network Folder<cifs-setup>` on your laptop/desktop.

#. Go to the :ref:`Embassy tab<embassy-tab>`, then click on ``Create Backup``.

#. Next, click on ``+ New Shared Folder`` to use your previously created backup folder.

#. Fill in the following fields:

    * Hostname - This is the hostname of the machine that your folder or drive is located on
    * Path - This is the directory path to the shared folder.  If you configured Samba yourself (Linux), this is the ``comment`` (name of the share in your samba config file) and not the path.
    * Username - This is the user on the remote machine that you used to create the shared directory
    * Password - This is your user (from above) password

    Then click ``Save``

#. You will see a freshly created "cloud" backup location available, click it for options, and click ``Create Backup`` to begin.

#. You can continue to use your Embassy while the backup is in progress.

#. When the backup is complete you will be notified in the :ref:`Notifications tab<notifications-tab>`, and you will see the date and time of your most recent backup updated under ``Backups`` in the Embassy tab.

Physical Backups
----------------

You may use a drive by attaching to Embassy directly if you prefer.  The recommended format at this time is ``exFAT``.

.. caution:: If using the Raspberry Pi, you MUST use external power to attach a physical drive in order to prevent any data corruption due to power constraints.

#. First, go to ``Embassy`` -> ``Create Backup``

    .. figure:: /_static/images/config/physical-backup0.png
        :width: 60%

#. Plug drive USB cable into Embassy.  If your drive is self-powered, you can plug it directly into your Embassy USB 3.0 (blue) slot. If not, first plug the drive into a powered USB hub, then plug the hub into your Embassy USB 3.0 slot.  Then you may power it up.

#. Press ``Refresh`` in the top-right corner, and select your drive when it appears.

#. Enter your password to continue with the backup.

After backup, you will receive a notice that the backup is complete, and you will see the latest backup date appear on the Embassy tab.
