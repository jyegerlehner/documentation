After installation or update, some services require configuration before they can be started.

Traditionally, configuring services was a massive headache and a huge barrier to running a personal server. But no more! The Embassy's revolutionary service config system makes the process transparent, simple, and safe.

Config options are defined by the service developer and can be almost anything. They are represented as simple UI elements - such as toggles and drop downs - and they include explanations and validations, such that users understand their purpose and are prevented from making mistakes.
