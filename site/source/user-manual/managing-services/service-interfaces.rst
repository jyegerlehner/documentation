Interfaces

Interfaces are URLs that a :ref:`Service<managing-services>` uses to communicate in various ways with other software.  Many Services will only have one interface, perhaps with a Tor and LAN address, to denote where it is hosted / accessed.  Other services, such as Bitcoin or Lightning Nodes, may have several interfaces for different use-cases.

To view the instructions for a particular service, navigate to the :ref:`Services tab <services-tab>` *> [Service Name] > Properties*.  From there you can copy a URL to your clipboard for use with external software.
