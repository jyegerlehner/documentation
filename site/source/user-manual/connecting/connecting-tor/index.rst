Connecting Over Tor
===================

You can connect to your Embassy from anywhere in the world, privately and anonymously, by using its unique Tor Address (.onion URL).

.. note:: Tor connection can sometimes be unreliable and have higher latency than normal internet connections.

Using a Tor Browser
-------------------

The fastest, easiest way to connect to your Embassy over Tor is to download a Tor-enabled browser and visit your Embassy's .onion URL. We recommend:

* Linux, Mac, Windows, Android

    * `Tor Browser <https://torproject.org/download/>`_
    * `Brave <https://brave.com>`_ (requires using Tor tabs)

* iOS

    * `Onion Browser <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448>`_

Using Firefox
