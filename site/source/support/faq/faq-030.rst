I'm trying to migrate my old Embassy data, but the device won't boot.  What do I do?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove the external drive and sd card adapter if they are plugged in.  Boot the device with just the new (16GB) sd card inserted.  After you hear the start-up sounds, you may plug in the external drive and old (128GB) sd card.

I cannot reach embassy.local after hearing the start-up sounds from Embassy.  What do I do?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Ensure that you are on the same network as your Embassy.  Check that it is not a "Guest" network in your router.
* Your browser might try to force https://embassy.local, delete the https:// and try again with just embassy.local.
