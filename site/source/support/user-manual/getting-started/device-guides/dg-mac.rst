.. note:: Please see Mac's :ref:`Known Limitations<lim-mac>` to understand what is currently not possible on these devices

LAN Setup (Connectivity, Performance)
-------------------------------------

`Setup LAN Access <https://docs.start9.com/support/user-manual/configuration/lan-setup/lan-mac>`_ for a fast and secure connection while on your Embassy's local network.

Tor Setup (Connectivity)
------------------------

`Setup Tor <https://docs.start9.com/support/user-manual/configuration/tor-setup/tor-os/tor-mac>`_ to run natively (in the background) on your device.  This will allow you to use applications on your Mac via the :ref:`Tor Network<tor>` so they can communicate with your Embassy.

Tor Firefox Config (Connectivity)
---------------------------------

`Configure Firefox <https://docs.start9.com/support/user-manual/configuration/tor-setup/tor-firefox/torff-mac>`_ to be able to use the :ref:`Tor Network<tor>` so that you can reach ``.onion`` sites without needing to change browsers.

Embassy Backups (Reliability)
-----------------------------

`Configure Remote Backup <https://docs.start9.com/support/user-manual/walkthrough/backup/backup-mac>`_ of your Embassy to your Mac device.  **Backups are supremely important** as they ensure redundancy of your data for convenience, as well as preventing loss in case of disaster.
