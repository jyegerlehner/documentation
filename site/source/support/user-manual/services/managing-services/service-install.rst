Installing

.. note:: Some services have :ref:`dependencies<service-dependencies>` on other services. Adding, updating, or removing a service can sometimes have requirements or consequences for other services. Your Embassy will always inform you of these issues along the way.

To add a new service, simply find it's listing inside the :ref:`Service Marketplace <service-marketplace>` tab: *[Service Name] >* ``Install``.  Let's install Synapse as an example:

    .. figure:: /_static/images/services/service0.png
        :width: 60%

    .. figure:: /_static/images/services/service1.png
        :width: 60%

Depending on the size of the service and your Internet connection, installation should take between 60 seconds and a few minutes.

You may click *View Service* at any time to view install progress, or after install to go to the Service page.  Many services will need to be configured after install.  You can use the default options, or change to your liking.  See :ref:`configuration<service-config>` for details.

    .. figure:: /_static/images/services/service3.png
        :width: 60%

You will see a screen like the following when install is complete.  Then you're ready to :ref:`configure <service-config>` your service!

.. note:: You can only use a service once its :ref:`dependencies <service-dependencies>` are met, its :ref:`configuration<service-config>` is complete, it has been started, and is in a *running* :ref:`status <service-status>`.
