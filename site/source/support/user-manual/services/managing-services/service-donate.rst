Currently, this is a link provided by the service package developer so that you may donate to them or the developer of the service they packaged directly.  If this is not provided, a pop-up message will let you know this, and you will need to find the devs on their own platforms in order to donate.

    We intend to leverage the power of Embassy's Lightning Network options to create the choice for a user to immediately send sats to a developer.  Ideally, this will have a percentage breakdown for the service developer, service packager, and Start9, for the user to delegate their donation as they choose.  We are serious about helping to incentivize :ref:`Open Source<open-source>` development.
