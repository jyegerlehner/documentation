Naviage to *Services > [Service Name] > Logs*

Every service emits logs while it is in a *running* state. Logs give an *under-the-hood* glimpse of a service and can be extremely useful for debugging purposes. To a non-technical user, logs may look like gibberish, and sometimes there is nothing to see at all.
