Backing Up Embassy
==================

There are 2 options for backing up your Embassy and all its service data.  You can setup a shared folder on a remote machine, such as a laptop or desktop, or you can backup to a local drive, which must be externally powered or plugged into a powered USB hub before plugging into Embassy.
