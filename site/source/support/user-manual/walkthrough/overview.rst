Backups
=======

One of the most important actions you can do on your Embassy is to keep a regular backup of your data.  See the page on :ref:`Backups<backups>`, and select your device for more details.  In this section, you can create, and restore from, backups.

Insights
========

The Insights section gives you basic information on your Embassy, monitoring of system resources / temperature, and logs for debugging.

Settings
========

The Settings section lets you change preferences, and manage `Connectivity` and Active Sessions.  See the documentation on :ref:`Configuration<config>` for more details.

.. _power:

Power
=====

Restart
.......

#. Be patient while services shut down. A *tune* will play, indicating the shutdown is complete.
#. A gentle *bep* will sound when the Embassy is powered back on.
#. A *chime* will sound when the Embassy is ready to use.  Please be patient as a Restart will take some time.

Shutdown
........

#. Be patient while services shut down, it may take some minutes. A *tune* will play, indicating the shutdown is complete.
#. It is now safe to unplug the Embassy from power and the ethernet cable, if connected.

.. note:: After a shutdown, the *only* way to turn your Embassy back on is to unplug it and plug it back in. As such, we do not recommend shutting down your Embassy when you are not physically near it. Instead, you should use the restart option.

.. _marketplace-tab:

Marketplace Tab
---------------

The Marketplace Tab is obviously the home of the Marketplace, where you can search out and install new Services, or manange existing ones.  You can view our live Marketplace `here <marketplace.start9.com>`_.
