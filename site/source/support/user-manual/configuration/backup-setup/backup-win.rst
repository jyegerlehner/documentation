There are 2 options for backing up your Embassy and all its service data.  You can setup a shared folder on a remote machine, such as a laptop or desktop, or you can backup to a local drive, which must be externally powered or plugged into a powered USB hub before plugging into Embassy.

Remote Backups
--------------

#. Create a folder
#. Right click the folder
#. Select "properties"
#. Click the share tab
#. Click share...
#. Select a user you want to use for login, or select everyone
#. Click share
#. Enter your computer name into the hostname field in embassy ui (the name is shown after a \\ in the windows ui)
#. Enter the path that is shown after the hostname in the windows ui into the path field
#. Enter your username for the windows computer
#. Enter the password for the windows computer

Local Backups
-------------

#. With Embassy powered down, plug in your external drive to the powered hub if you are using one, or directly into Embassy's available USB 3.0 (blue) slot if it is externally powered.
#. Plug in power to your hub or drive
#. Boot Embassy and go to ``Embassy`` -> ``Create Backup``
