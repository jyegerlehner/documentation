.. #. As in the :ref:`Set Device Name<device-name>` steps above, go to the ``Embasssy`` tab, then under ``Settings``, click ``Preferences``

.. #. Click ``Auto Report Bugs`` and either ``Enable`` or ``Disable``

.. _auto-update:

Automatically Check for Updates
-------------------------------

Automatic check for updates enables you to choose whether you want to be informed of EmbassyOS updates. Enabling this feature makes a request to the Start9 Marketplace to see if a new OS version has been released, and notifies you if so. This request is only made when you log into a new session or refresh your current session.

#. Go to the ``Embasssy`` tab, then under ``Settings``, click ``Preferences``

#. Click ``Automatically Check for Updates`` and either ``Enable`` or ``Disable``
