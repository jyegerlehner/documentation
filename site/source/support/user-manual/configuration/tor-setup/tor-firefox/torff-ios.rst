Unfortunately, Apple does not allow tor to be run natively on iOS.  This means that Firefox cannot be configured to use tor.  This leaves the following options:

You can use Start9's own Consulate Browser, which is available `here <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/start9-consulate-browser/id1528124570>`_, or you can select another Tor Browser by searching the `App Store <https://www.apple.com/us/search/onion-browser?src=serp>`_.
