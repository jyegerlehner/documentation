Setting up WiFi
===============

Although we highly recommend a wired (ethernet) connection for best performance, you can connect your Embassy with a wireless connection if you prefer.  Follow the directions below to connect to a WiFi network, or save your credentials for later to connect to a network you are not currently in proximity to.

#. On the ``Embassy`` tab, Under ``Settings``, Click  ``WiFi``

#. Select the network you would like from the list of available networks.  You will get an idea of signal strength on the right, from red (weak signal) to green (strong signal).  If you can move your Embassy closer to the WiFi broadcasting device, you will get a better signal, and as a result, better performance.

   .. tip:: You may also select the network labeled ``Other`` at the bottom of the list in order to add a hidden network, or a network that is not nearby, for connecting to at a later time.

#. Enter your WiFi password and either select ``Save for Later`` or ``Save and Connect`` to connect immediately.

#. If you saved the network, it will appear in the list when successfully added, but not show connected.  If you connect immediately, you will receive a dialogue box and a green checkmark to show connection is live.

    :alt: Connect

#. Click on a saved network for connection options.  If you are successfully connected, you will receive a dialogue box and a green checkmark to show connection is live.  At this point, you can safely disconnect the ethernet cable from your Embassy, if you wish to use WiFi.
