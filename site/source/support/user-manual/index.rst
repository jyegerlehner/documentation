  EmbassyOS is designed to work out of the box with a minimal setup and immediate practicality.  That said, there are many use-cases and utilities that can be added and tweaked at your convenience, which are covered extensively in this manual.  You can get started right away with :ref:`Initial Setup <initial-setup>`, head to our :doc:`Walkthrough <walkthrough/index>` for a guided tour, or learn about :doc:`Services <services/index>` and how to use them.  In the :doc:`Configuration <configuration/index>` and :doc:`Tuning <tuning/index>` chapters, you can put your Embassy to work, and make it unique.  Finally, you can cure common issues with :doc:`Troubleshooting <troubleshooting/index>` or find answers in our :ref:`FAQ<faq>`.

  For further information, check out our :ref:`Knowledge Base <Learn>` to learn about the technologies behind Embassy.  If you want to build your own Embassy, check out the :ref:`DIY Guide<diy>`.  When you're ready to build, please check out our :ref:`Developer Docs <dev-docs>`.  Please don't hestitate to :ref:`Contact Us <contact>` if you have any issues, questions, or suggestions.
