Do I need to be a professional developer or have coding experience to contribute?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely not!  Contributions can be as simple as finding a typo in our docs, making a suggestion on GitHub, creating educational or promotional content, and the list goes on!  Everyone that wants to contribute can do so in some unique way.  Please don't hesitate to :ref:`Contact <contact>` us for ideas if you're not sure where to begin.



.. Expound the following into FAQs:
.. --------------------------------

.. - Release notes need to be in quotations? As it is a string? (they aren’t by default) – this is a yaml thing and SOMETIMES they are required and SOMETIMES NOT
.. - Alerts in LND example are not wrapped in quotes, same with CUPS release notes – yaml thing
.. - Ports in manifest – can leave as default (80), as it is a docker container?? - Sure

.. - Type definitions – is this just for dependencies? Can a blurb be added here for extra clarity?
.. - Config spec – Admin pass?
