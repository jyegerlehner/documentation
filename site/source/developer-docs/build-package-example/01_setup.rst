What we'll build

1. Create a simple hello world web service
2. Create a Dockerfile
3. Create a Package Manifest
4. Create a hosted repository which will contain all the service components
5. Create the packaged service file

You can find the `complete code <https://github.com/Start9Labs/hello-world-wrapper>`_ referenced in this guide on GitHub.
