    The product key is used to discover your Embassy's IP address on the Local Area Network using a hashing function and a protocol named MDNS (or Zeroconf). Once in possession of the Embassy's local IP address, the Setup App can now communicate directly with the Embassy.

    If your router does not support mDNS

    * On your desktop or laptop computer, navigate to your router configuration settings within the browser. This is usually an IP address such as 192.168.1.1. A simple Google search will usually reveal how to access the router configuration settings for a particular brand.
    * Once in the router config settings, find the section that lists the devices on your network. You should see an item labeled "start9labs". Take note of the associated IP address and enter it into the Setup App in the "LAN IP Address" input field.

    In this step, the Setup App will provide your Embassy with three pieces of critical information:

    * A ed25519 private key. Used by the Embassy to create a .onion public address for encrypted and anonymous communication over Tor.
    * A 4096 bit RSA private key, used by the Embassy to create a SSL certificate for encrypted communication over LAN.
    * Your master password, used by the Embassy to authenticate you as its one and only master. If you lose this password, there is no way to access your Embassy ever again. You will be forced to reset the device, resulting in permanent loss of data.
    
    All three secrets are packaged together and transmitted to the Embassy encrypted with its product key.

Setup Complete!
===============

Your Embassy is now hosted on the private web. You can view and manage your Embassy by visiting its unique ``.onion`` URL from any Tor-enabled browser. The Setup App contains our recommendations for various devices.
