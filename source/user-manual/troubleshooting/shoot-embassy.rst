If the device will not power on at all (no lights whatsoever), then the only issues could be that the Pi is not getting the power it needs, or it is completely dead (extremely rare).

If you received your device from us and it will not power up at all, please `Contact us<contact>` for assistance.

I'm having an issue with a particular Service
.............................................
If a Service is crashing or acting up in some way, check the `Documentation<services>` and `FAQ<faq-services>` for that particular Service.  You can also check the `Logs` of a service, which might tell you what the problem is.  If that is not helpful, try to restart the service to see if that clears up the issue.  If you are still having issues, please reach out in one of our `Community Channels` for immediate assistance, or email support@start9labs.com for help during business hours.
