Updating EmbassyOS
******************

#. Navigate to ``Menu > Embassy``
#. Click "Check for Updates"
#. If there is an update available, you will be prompted to install it.
#. While updating, your Embassy will emit a gentle chime every 20 seconds.
#. You can also enable automatic check for updates in the :ref:`Embassy config <auto-update>` tab.

.. note:: Ensure you have a stable Internet connection, and do not unplug your Embassy during an update. Updates usually complete within a few minutes, but depending on the size of the update and your Internet bandwidth, they can sometimes take up to an hour.
