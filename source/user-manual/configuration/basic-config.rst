.. _auto-update:

Automatic check for updates enables you to choose whether you want to be informed of EmbassyOS updates. Enabling this feature makes a request to the Start9 Marketplace to see if a new OS version has been released, and notifies you if so. This request is only made when you log into a new session or refresh your current session.
