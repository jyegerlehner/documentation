Restart
=======

#. Be patient while services shut down. A *tune* will play, indicating the shutdown is complete. 
#. A gentle *bep* will sound when the Embassy is powered back on.
#. A *chime* will sound when the Embassy is ready to use.  Please be patient as a Restart will take some time.

Shutdown
========

#. Be patient while services shut down. A *tune* will play, indicating the shutdown is complete. 
#. It is now safe to unplug the Embassy from power and the ethernet cable, if connected.

.. note:: After a shutdown, the *only* way to turn your Embassy back on is to unplug it and plug it back in. As such, we do not recommend shutting down your Embassy when you are not physically near it. Instead, you should use the restart option.
