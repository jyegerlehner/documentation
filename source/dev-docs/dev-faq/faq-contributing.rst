Do I need to be a professional developer or have coding experience to contribute?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely not!  Contributions can be as simple as finding a typo in our docs, making a suggestion on GitHub, creating educational or promotional content, and the list goes on!  Everyone that wants to contribute can do so in some unique way.  Please don't hesitate to ***CONTACT LINK*** us for ideas if you're not sure where to begin.

Expound the following into FAQs move to other dev-faq section if necessary:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Release notes need to be in quotations? As it is a string? (they aren’t by default) – this is a yaml thing and SOMETIMES they are required and SOMETIMES NOT
- Ports in manifest – can leave as default (80), as it is a docker container?? - Sure
- Type definitions – is this just for dependencies? Can a blurb be added here for extra clarity?
- Alerts in LND example are not wrapped in quotes, same with CUPS release notes – yaml thing
- Config spec – Admin pass?
- Makefile
	- Not required, but simplifies dev process
