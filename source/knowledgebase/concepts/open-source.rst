The Internet itself was built on free and publicly available code, with the values of collaboration, peer review, communication, and openness built into its very foundation. This decentralized model evolved into the open source movement, which uses these values to discover new ways to solve problems across boundaries and industries.

Open source software centered around the concept of user freedoms: freedom to see, modify, and redistribute the code to make it work for the user in whatever way they needed. It does not necessarily mean free to use. It means that the software will be better, cheaper, and more flexible if it is freely accessible, openly modifiable, and shared.

If anyone can inspect, modify, and distribute the code, bugs are more rapidly resolved, security vulnerabilities are more quickly audited and exposed. Community driven development efforts enable diverse collaboration which increases project reliability and longevity.

Distinct from open source software is proprietary, or closed source, software. Closed source software is strictly moderated, cannot legally be altered, copied, or distributed, and is paid for to be used as intended without modification. Only the code owners have the right to access the code.

As a company founded on the principles of freedom, every service we support is open source. We believe in contributing to the future of this vibrant and passionate ecosystem.
