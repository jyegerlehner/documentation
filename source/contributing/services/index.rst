Service Packaging Guide
***********************

This technical guide covers the necessary steps to package up a service for deployment to an Embassy. To start, you will need to acquire :ref:`EmbassyOS <purchasing>` for testing the packaged service.

While you are waiting to assemble a device, you can begin the process of building your project in the format necessary to run on the Embassy. The sections below outline these steps in detail.

For reference, the `Hello world <https://github.com/Start9Labs/hello-world-wrapper>`_ repository should be used as an example. A project template can be cloned using the "Use this template" button in GitHub.
