Within each wrapper repository should exist a ``docs`` directory. This folder should include any pertinent documentation, instructions, external integrations, or other details about the service that users or developers might find relevant.

If an ``instructions.md`` file is included, this markdown formatted file will be rendered in the "Instructions" tab within the service detail menu on EmbassyOS:
