.. note:: Some services have :ref:`dependencies<managing-dependencies>` on other services. Adding, updating, or removing a service can sometimes have requirements or consequences for other services. Your Embassy will inform you of these issues along the way.

Installing

Depending on the size of the service and your Internet connection, installation should take between 60 seconds and a few minutes.

After installation, you can view the service's instructions by navigating to ``Services > [Service Name] > Instructions``

.. note:: You can only start and use a service once its dependencies are met, its :ref:`configuration<service-config>` complete, and is in a *running* state.


Updating

To see if an update is available for a service, you can click the *refresh* button inside the dashboard of the installed service or by visiting its listing in the Service Marketplace.

If an update is available, simply click ``Update`` and confirm the action.


Uninstalling
