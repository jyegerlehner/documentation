Managing Dependencies
*********************

Some services have dependencies on other services. A service may even require its dependency to be *configured* in a particular way.

Traditionally, managing dependencies was a massive headache and a huge barrier to running a personal server. But no more! The Embassy's revolutionary dependency management system makes the process transparent and simple.

If a service has one or more dependencies, or a dependency needs to be configured in a particular way, your Embassy will inform you and offer solutions.

Sometimes, a dependency can be satisfied in multiple ways. For example, Lightning has a dependency on Bitcoin. But that does not necessarily mean you need to have Bitcoin installed on your Embassy. You could just as easily configure Lightning to use another Bitcoin node located somewhere else!
